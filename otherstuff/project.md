## Recent projects

* __Energy Management System for Android Kernel__

This project is aimed at creating a system to enable assigning and enforcement of strict energy quotas for android apps. This fixed energy quotas are assigned by users to save energy used by less priority apps. This project is implemented as a Android kernel module and completely in C.

* __REST Framework Over Named Data Networking__

Named data networking(NDN) is a future Internet architecture which is aimed at routing based on content names rather than IP addresses. NDN can be a ideal network between microservices as it has in-build support for features such as service discovery, load balancing ...etc. In this project, we implemented a framework to enable existing microservice applications to be deployed on NDN with minimal effort. To achieve this we implemented REST support for NDN network and a new flow balancing algorithm to address needs of REST based applications. It is implemented in C++ and Python. See the code in [GitHub repo](https://github.com/asystemsguy/Microservices-over-NDN).

* __MPI Cluster Network Simulator Using Linux Traffic Control__

This project is to simulate network properties such as delay, jitter, packet loss in MPI applications deployed over a virtual cluster. It is achieved by using Linux Kernel Traffic module and implemented in Python, See the code in [GitHub repo](https://github.com/asystemsguy/MPI-network-simulator).
